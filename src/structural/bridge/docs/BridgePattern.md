## Pattern Overview

### Problem Statement
How to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently? This is particularly important when both the abstraction and its implementation need to be extended through subclasses without affecting each other.

### Pattern Description
The Bridge pattern separates an abstraction from its implementation so that both can vary independently. It involves:

- **Abstraction**: Defines the abstraction's interface and maintains a reference to the implementation (`Abstraction`)
- **Refined Abstraction**: Extends the abstraction interface (`RefinedAbstraction`)
- **Implementation**: Defines the interface for implementation classes (`Implementation`)
- **Concrete Implementation**: Implements the Implementation interface (`ConcreteImplementation`)

The pattern uses composition over inheritance to achieve flexibility, allowing both the abstraction and implementation hierarchies to evolve independently.

### Benefits
1. **Decoupling**: Separates interface from implementation, allowing them to vary independently.
2. **Improved extensibility**: Both abstraction and implementation can be extended without affecting each other.
3. **Hiding implementation details**: Clients interact only with the abstraction, not the implementation.
4. **Reduced class explosion**: Avoids the exponential growth of classes that would result from using inheritance alone.
5. **Runtime binding**: The implementation can be selected or changed at runtime.

### Consequences of Not Following
1. **Tight coupling**: Abstraction and implementation would be tightly coupled, making changes difficult.
2. **Class explosion**: Using inheritance alone would lead to an exponential growth of classes.
3. **Reduced flexibility**: Changes to either abstraction or implementation would affect the other.
4. **Code duplication**: Similar functionality might be duplicated across different classes.
5. **Difficulty in extending**: Adding new abstractions or implementations would require modifying existing code.

## Use Case Analysis

### Context
Note: The Bridge pattern is included in the project structure but not fully implemented in the current codebase. This documentation provides a theoretical analysis of how the pattern would be applied.

A typical context for the Bridge pattern would be a cross-platform drawing application that needs to render shapes on different operating systems. The system would need:
- Different shape abstractions (Circle, Square, Triangle)
- Different rendering implementations (WindowsRenderer, MacRenderer, LinuxRenderer)
- The ability to add new shapes or renderers without affecting existing code

### Pattern Application
The Bridge pattern would be applied as follows:
1. `Shape` would be the abstraction interface with a reference to a `Renderer` implementation.
2. `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle` would be refined abstractions extending `Shape`.
3. `Renderer` would be the implementation interface with methods like `drawLine()`, `drawCircle()`, etc.
4. `WindowsRenderer`, `MacRenderer`, and `LinuxRenderer` would be concrete implementations.
5. Each shape would use its renderer to draw itself, delegating the platform-specific rendering to the implementation.

### Benefits Realization
1. **Flexibility**: New shapes could be added without affecting renderers, and new renderers could be added without affecting shapes.
2. **Clarity**: The code would clearly separate shape logic from rendering logic.
3. **Reusability**: Renderers could be reused across different shapes, and shapes could be rendered on different platforms.
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to rendering logic would be isolated to the renderer implementations.
5. **Extensibility**: The system could be easily extended with new shapes or renderers without modifying existing code.

In a complete implementation, the Bridge pattern would successfully decouple shape abstractions from rendering implementations, allowing both to vary independently and making the system more flexible and maintainable.
